## 🔄 How to Update with Real Content

### Option 1: Manual Updates (Recommended for now)
1. **Get your content from Contentful**:
   - Go to your Contentful dashboard
   - Export your blog posts and projects
   - Note the titles, descriptions, URLs, and published dates

2. **Update the RSS feed**:
   - Open `scripts/generate-rss.js`
   - Replace the sample items with your actual content
   - Run `npm run generate-rss` to regenerate

### Option 2: Automated Updates (Future enhancement)
For a fully automated solution, you could:
1. Create a build script that fetches from Contentful
2. Set up environment variables for Contentful API
3. Run the script during your build process
