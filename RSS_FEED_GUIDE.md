# RSS Feed Setup Guide

## ✅ Current Status
Your RSS feed is now working and **automatically generated** on every deployment! Available at: **https://michaellunzer.com/rss.xml**

## 📝 What's Currently Working
- ✅ RSS feed is **automatically generated** during build process
- ✅ Fetches real content from Contentful when available
- ✅ Falls back to welcome content when no posts are available
- ✅ Proper XML structure with RSS 2.0 format
- ✅ Includes both blogs and projects categories
- ✅ Valid RSS feed that can be consumed by RSS readers
- ✅ Link in your banner component points to the correct URL
- ✅ **Zero manual work required** - completely automated!

## 🔄 How Content is Updated

### ✅ **Fully Automated** (Current Implementation)
The RSS feed is now **completely automated** and requires **zero manual work**:

1. **Automatic Content Fetching**: 
   - During build, the script automatically fetches your latest blog posts and projects from Contentful
   - Uses your existing environment variables (`SPACE_ID` and `API_KEY`)
   - Sorts content by published date (newest first)

2. **Smart Fallbacks**:
   - If Contentful credentials aren't available, shows a welcome message
   - If no posts are found, displays fallback content
   - Always generates a valid RSS feed regardless of content availability

3. **Build Integration**:
   - RSS generation runs automatically during `npm run build`
   - Happens on every deployment (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
   - No manual intervention required

### 🔧 Environment Variables
To enable automatic content fetching, ensure these are set in your deployment environment:
- `SPACE_ID` - Your Contentful space ID
- `API_KEY` - Your Contentful API key

If these aren't set, the RSS feed will still work with fallback content.
