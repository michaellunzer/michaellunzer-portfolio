# Resume Download Setup - Simple Version

## ðŸš€ **Recommended Approach: Host PDF on Vercel**

Instead of embedding the PDF as base64, we'll host it directly on Vercel and send a download link via email.

## ðŸ“‹ **Setup Steps:**

### **Step 1: Add Your Resume PDF**
1. Place your resume PDF file in the `public/` directory
2. Your current filename: `Michael Lunzer Resume 7-15-24.pdf`
3. The file will be available at: `https://yourdomain.com/Michael%20Lunzer%20Resume%207-15-24.pdf`

### **Step 2: Set Environment Variables**
Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# SendGrid API Key (required)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here

# Resume URL (optional - defaults to your domain)
RESUME_URL=https://michaellunzer.com/Michael%20Lunzer%20Resume%207-15-24.pdf
```

### **Step 3: Deploy to Vercel**
1. Push your changes to GitHub
2. Vercel will automatically deploy
3. Your resume will be available at the public URL

## âœ… **Benefits of This Approach:**

- **ðŸŽ¯ Simpler**: No need to convert PDF to base64
- **ðŸ“± Better UX**: Users can view PDF online or download
- **ðŸ”„ Easier Updates**: Just replace the PDF file and redeploy
- **âš¡ Faster**: Smaller emails, faster delivery
- **ðŸ’¾ No Size Limits**: Can use high-quality PDFs
- **ðŸ”§ Easier Maintenance**: No environment variable size issues

## ðŸ”— **How It Works:**

1. User enters email on your site
2. Form sends request to `/api/send-resume`
3. API sends email with download link (not attachment)
4. User clicks link to download/view resume
5. You get email notification of the request

## ðŸ“§ **Email Preview:**

The email will look like:
```
Hi there!

Thanks for requesting my resume! You can download it using the link below:

[ðŸ“„ Download Resume] (styled button)

If the button doesn't work, you can copy and paste this link into your browser:
https://michaellunzer.com/Michael%20Lunzer%20Resume%207-15-24.pdf

Best regards,
Michael Lunzer
```

## ðŸš¨ **Important Notes:**

- **PDF Location**: Must be in `public/` directory to be accessible
- **File Size**: Keep PDF under 10MB for best performance
- **Updates**: Replace the PDF file and redeploy to update
- **Security**: PDF will be publicly accessible (usually fine for resumes)

## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting:**

- **PDF not accessible**: Make sure it's in the `public/` directory
- **Email not sending**: Check your SendGrid API key
- **Link broken**: Verify the `RESUME_URL` environment variable

This approach is much cleaner and more maintainable than the base64 method!
