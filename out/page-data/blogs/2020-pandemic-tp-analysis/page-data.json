Many people's first reaction to this was to prepare for the absolute worst and stockpile resources, including Toilet Paper (TP).</p>\n<p>There were videos posted online of people from all around the world fighting for TP -- here's one:</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Y1nEnOmC6IQ?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />\n<p>Fortunately, I didn't have an immediate need for any, as I had just bought a 30 pack before the pandemic. Unfortunately, I was unable to find any in stock, and was concerned that there would be a day that I would need to replenish my inventory.</p>\n<p>I thought back to my days working in Supply Chain and remembered a framed quote that was above one of the manager's desk:</p>\n<h2><em>\"If it can be measured, it can be improved\"</em></h2>\n<p>So, I decided to <em>get down to business</em> and <em>create a log</em>.</p>\n<p>After gathering the data, I needed to graph it:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/o4gibwve10tr/JI3liX7pnBU1DCW7O4D39/525df93a1b3ffc4b6df95b18f4fdb824/Quarentine_2020_TP_Consumption.png\" alt=\"Quarantine 2020 TP Consumption\"></p>\n<p>If you just calculate the difference between the dates of each roll (how long each roll lasted) you get an average of <strong>4.96 days</strong>.</p>\n<p>There are a bunch of other ways to <a href=\"https://abcsupplychain.com/en/safety-stock-formula-calculation/\">calculate safety stock</a>, <em>butt</em> I'm not sure we need to invest that much thought into it.</p>\n<p>There are a number of contributing factors impacting the average lifespan of a TP roll like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>number of users</li>\n<li>what brand (and therefore size of roll)</li>\n<li>amount of time spending at the house</li>\n<li>if you're lactose intolerant</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyways, that's a huge <em>dump</em> of information and probably more than enough for a while! It just made me feel better knowing that how many days of TP I had available. Now, I can count how many rolls I have, do some back of the napkin calculations and multiply that by 5 to quickly figure out how many days I can without buying more inventory.</p>\n<p>For example, 26 rolls x 5 = 130 days. Ask yourself, \"will I be able to buy TP in the next 130 days?\" -- I'm sure knowing that will be <em>a huge relief</em>!</p>"}},"createdAt":"2020-08-13T06:37:40.237Z"},"contentfulSiteInformation":{"siteUrl":"https://michaellunzer.com","twiteerHandle":"@michaellunzer"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2020-pandemic-tp-analysis"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1194089924","1242132861","1746898652","1794736483","425184262","603260039","868401008"]}
