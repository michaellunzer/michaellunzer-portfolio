Also, I think my grandparents would be happy that someone is actually using it again.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/o4gibwve10tr/5KP6JUiP5Y9FSwYQ1r65R1/dbf101e3f43f4830bec29010463e2895/Retro_BT8.jpg\" alt=\"Retro BT8\"></p>\n<p>I searched on eBay for a <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/sch/sis.html?_nkw=Wireless+Stereo+Bluetooth+Audio+Receiver+Board+3W+%2F+5W+x2+Amplifier+Sound+Module&#x26;_id=262059485900&#x26;&#x26;_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2658\">bluetooth audio reciever</a> that was powerful enough to power a speaker. 2-6 weeks later, an ePacket arrived at my house.</p>\n<p>I found the perfect set of <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/sch/sis.html?_nkw=M19+Metal+PushButton+Switch+Panel+Mount+-+Momentary+type+-+Coffee+Chrome+Plated&#x26;_id=381275852697&#x26;&#x26;_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2658\">metal pushbuttons</a> to put on the radio -- they were the \"coffee\" color, so they looked brown and not too out of place.</p>\n<p>I was trying to keep the original aesthetic and didn't want flashing LEDs taking away from the device's authenticity. The push button's seller accidentally sent me a button with a seized washer on it. I sent him a photo and explained what happened and he mailed out a new unit a few days later. He was really great about it. Eventually, I unsoldered the buttons to control the device and soldered on new buttons.</p>\n<h2>Miscalculations</h2>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/o4gibwve10tr/7ixJg5Qmmm5ixyzlxXo8DC/e996bec304fd3b5ccd2e6f3df8d02c68/Retro_BT10.jpg\" alt=\"Retro BT10\"></p>\n<p>I used a bench grinder to remove some material on the bracket that kept all the components in place.</p>\n<p>My Dad's \"workshop\" aka the basement (where I can make a mess with the bench grinder, table saw, etc.) is accessible only from the outside of his house. It was cold and raining, so I was trying to minimize the trips between the \"lab\" and the \"workshop\".</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I misjudged the place where I should grind the bracket, and had to make a second trip to grind down just a bit more.</p>\n<p>I think it came together really nicely!</p>\n<p><strong>The hardest parts of the project were:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>waiting for parts</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>measuring where to cut the holes in the wooden radio</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I knew I had to be extremely careful to place the buttons to avoid the internal components. Also, I felt I would disappoint my grandparents by destroying one of their antiques. I'm glad everything worked out in the end!</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/o4gibwve10tr/3CjByrCmiHxUczZmbCXhzD/e52c54c7701a56116950d26e4b48e230/Retro_BT1.jpg\" alt=\"Retro BT1\"></p>\n<p>It goes well with my room's built in cabinetry and the overall refined look.</p>"}},"createdAt":"2020-07-31T21:28:35.157Z","publishedDate":"2017-04-14"},"contentfulSiteInformation":{"siteUrl":"https://michaellunzer.com","twiteerHandle":"@michaellunzer"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"retroBT"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1194089924","1242132861","1746898652","1794736483","425184262","603260039","868401008"]}
