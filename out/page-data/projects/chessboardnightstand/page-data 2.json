I started looking for some inspiration online and kept coming back to chessboards. I also needed another night stand to balance out the fung shui in my room. I was worried that this project might be a bit ambitious for a short class (3 hours a week x 10 weeks), but I figured if I ran out of time, at least I would have a nice chessboard.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/o4gibwve10tr/3pWqODlyIDCPHWpF0h7GHh/8a993ee8c01aec890768e1103d9121a1/woodworking1.jpg\" alt=\"woodworking1\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/o4gibwve10tr/71eLl4jWE6hx20eQP2x47s/ad03439be16512175673fe77126ebdda/woodworking2.jpg\" alt=\"woodworking2\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/o4gibwve10tr/wbzeruSEF3ZVQx2wZXvyR/102a55649377bc8008fe5774ffb4f7a2/woodworking3.jpg\" alt=\"woodworking3\"></p>\n<p>I took the class with my friend/coworker/carpool buddy Rob Gillin. Under the tutelage of master woodworker Bob, we learned a lot and made some cool projects.</p>\n<p>In the beginning, I didn't take too many photos because there was nothing too exciting about cutting a few strips of wood and gluing them together. Here is one of my first cuts of the project:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/o4gibwve10tr/43OtcWLi0MSDXUIJoZMvJX/76e62571867e11e782dc129d9ad5757d/woodworking4.jpg\" alt=\"woodworking4\"></p>\n<p>After cutting the strips to the desired length of one side of the final square, you glue them in alternating colors (light / dark) repeating so you eventually have a group of 8 strips. Sometimes it is hard to glue more than 2 pieces of wood together at a time, so I would clamp pairs together then after about 30 minutes, they could be combined to another set.</p>\n<p>Eventually, you will have 8 strips of alternating wood all glued together. Do not worry about planing or sanding, as this board still needs to get cut perpendicular to the strips.</p>\n<p>This is where the magic happens... once you cut each strip perpendicular using a sled and a stop block, you can rotate every other strip so the pattern switches, creating a checkered pattern.</p>\n<p>Once this happens, again create pairs and start gluing them together. If all goes well and your math as well as cuts are accurate, you will have a square chessboard comprised of square squares.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Think of each cut like you would approach hitting a golf ball.
