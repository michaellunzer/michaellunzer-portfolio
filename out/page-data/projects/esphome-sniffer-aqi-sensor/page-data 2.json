The air quality restricted people to go outside (even in a pandemic) to exercise or even just open up our windows to get a cool breeze. Here's an <a href=\"https://data.visaliatimesdelta.com/fires/\">interactive map</a> to see all current fires going on in the country.</p>\n<p>I came across the \"Sniffer\" project on the <a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/t/sniffer-air-quality-sensor-using-esp32-with-lcd-pmsa003-bme680/226870\">Home Assistant Forums</a> this summer and knew I wanted to build this project to get more insight into my environment around me and also do something productive with my free time.</p>\n<h2>This was the view outside my house:</h2>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/o4gibwve10tr/2sCKF2ynllpYbRa4D2vu6t/ff802665e90aab3dff4545fc4a351abd/IMG_3890.jpeg\" alt=\"orange-skies-sf\"></p>\n<p>This project wouldn't be possible without <a href=\"https://blog.kylemanna.com/hardware/sniffer-air-quality-monitor-aqi-using-esp32-pmsa003-bme680/\">Kyle Manna</a> -- he actually reached out to me directly after seeing that I starred his <a href=\"https://github.com/kylemanna/sniffer\">GitHub Repo</a> noticed that I was local. We had a nice phone conversation and chatted about Home-Assistant and ESPHome. Ultimately, we met up briefly and he gave me two PCBs so I could make two air quality sensors.</p>\n<p>Please check out his website and GitHub for more information! I just wanted to show how easy it was to follow along with his instructions.</p>\n<h2>Pictures of the Build Process:</h2>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/o4gibwve10tr/3qIUs2yLSZu2BK0G6zrrGq/f2a666638cd5beb4676dfebc006d07b7/IMG_4331.jpeg\" alt=\"esphome-sniffer-aqi-2\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/o4gibwve10tr/2HqSR0Ebk4SMPE2GmCFS8P/752d3305f7c4a8bd38ed58cb855c6dac/IMG_4167.jpeg\" alt=\"esphome-sniffer-aqi-1\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/o4gibwve10tr/4kfe3FLNKWToq7nNlP2aF/4c23d2db5edbb60d9af1f5127c46ac08/IMG_4163.jpeg\" alt=\"esphome-sniffer-aqi-3\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/o4gibwve10tr/6aL5T6NKeIoctmTYmEB23h/7e2ac1dd677c2e8f0962c3aa00f6ba25/IMG_4165.jpeg\" alt=\"esphome-sniffer-aqi-cover\"></p>"}},"createdAt":"2020-11-04T03:17:25.314Z","publishedDate":"2020-11-03"},"contentfulSiteInformation":{"siteUrl":"https://michaellunzer.com","twiteerHandle":"@michaellunzer"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"esphome-sniffer-aqi-sensor"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1194089924","1242132861","1746898652","1794736483","425184262","603260039","868401008"]}
